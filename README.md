# Validation of Human Organoid-Derived PRs

Repository containing the thesis work for I completed for my M.S. at UC San Diego while I was working in the Wahlin Lab.
My thesis work revolved around using single-cell RNA sequencing output from PIPseq to assess the validity of human photoreceptors (PRs) derived from retinal organoids. I primarily use ```R``` with ```Seurat``` through the 
course of my analyses, as well as ```Python``` with ```PyTorch``` and ```scvi-tools``` to conduct some analyses with ML models. In addition to the data analysis, I conducted processing of the raw sequencing output through a local Linux instance. I also led hands-on experiments for this research, including nucleic acid extractions and library preparation. 


## Embargo

Due to a departmental required 2-year embargo, I am unable to make the data used in my thesis publicly available until Sept 2026. For now I have my abstract in this repository, although I have plans to add the scripts and code used in my thesis with all proprietary data removed.
