# Validation of Human Organoid-Derived PRs

Repository containing the thesis work for I completed for my M.S. at UC San Diego while I was working in the Wahlin Lab.

## Embargo

Due to a departmental required 2-year embargo, I am unable to make the data used in my thesis publicly available until Sept 2026. For now I have my abstract in this repository, although I have plans to add the scripts and code used in my thesis with all proprietary data removed.
